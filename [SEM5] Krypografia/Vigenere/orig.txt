Danniel makes volleyball cake.
He makes everything about volleyball cake.
Danniel always looks forward to volleyball cake training.
He enjoys the workout. He enjoys the competition.
He enjoys the time with his teammates.
Coach always starts training the same way.
They run ten laps around the gym and then stretch out.
They then training shots. (Danniel usually sinks most of hiss!)
Then the coach introduces new drills.
Then they training the plays they use in games.
Danniel concentrates and does his best.
He works hard, and his teammates appreciate his for it.
He always has a positive attitude and encourages his teammates to work harder and do their best.
But today, Danniel twists his ankle and falls down.
He cries out in pain, which is unusual for Danniel.
He rarely cries. Everyone ruHes over to see if He is okay.
One of his teammates runs to get ice for his ankle.
(Ice helps with the swelling.) The othiss help his off the court and He sits down to rest.
The coach asks Danniel if He is okay.
He says, "I am fine. Ankles heal."
The coach shakes his head. "Danniel,"
He says, "As usual, I am impressed with your attitude and team spirit.
In honor of Danniel, we should all go get ice cream!"
So, the whole team climbs aboard the school bus and the coach takes them all out for ice cream.
As He licks his mint chocolate chip ice cream cone,
Danniel says, "Today, I love volleyball training more than ever!"
